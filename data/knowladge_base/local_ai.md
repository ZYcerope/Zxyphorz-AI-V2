# Local 'AI' Without External APIs

You can build AI-like behavior without any hosted API by combining:
- deterministic tools (math, search, CRUD)
- a personal knowledge base (notes, docs)
- retrieval (BM25)
- simple intent routing (rules)

## Why this is still valuable
For a portfolio, this shows:
- clean architecture
- data storage
- routing logic
- UI integration
- testing and reliability

## Upgrade path
If you later want a real language model:
- keep the same architecture
- swap the response generator to a local model (optional)
